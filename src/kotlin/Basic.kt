   // For a variable to hold a null value, it must be of a nullable type. You can specify a variable as
    // being nullable by suffixing its type with ?, as shown in the following example:

    val a2: String? = null

    // Kotlin does not include a traditional ternary operator, instead favoring the use of conditional expressions
    //As the complexity of your conditional statement grows, you might consider replacing your
    // if-else expression with a when expression, as shown in the following example:

    val answerString2 = when {
        count == 42 -> "I have the answer."
        count > 35 -> "The answer is close."

    //Kotlinâ€™s conditionals highlight one of its more powerful features, smart casting. Rather than using
    // the safe-call operator or the not-null assertion operator to work with nullable values,
    // you can instead check if a variable contains a reference to a null value using a conditional
    // statement, as shown in the following example:

    val languageName3: String? = null
    if (languageName3 != null) {
        // No need to write languageName?.toUpperCase()
        println(languageName3.toUpperCase())

    //Simplifying function declarations
